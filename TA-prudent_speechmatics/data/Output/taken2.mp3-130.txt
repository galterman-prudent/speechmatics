I'll take one of those little cats once got the pips on the top. It's a grenade. I want you to go to the balcony with the grenade. Is there a safe place you can throw it? There's a parking garage. Everyone on it? No. I want you to pull the pin out of the grenade. Count to three so I can hear it. Toss it as far as you can. Run back into the wall. Keep the phone off so I can hear the explosion. 1, 2, 3.
